# Project Name


This project involved making an online version of Guess Who, where the player has to guess - from an array of characters -, which one the computer has secretely chosen. 

## The problem

I followed the detailed steps provided by Technigo to approach this problem. Using event listeners and variables, I was able to listen for events and then store the inputs. These were then compared to the stored data of the secret person and using conditional statements, I was able to inform the player if their guess was correct etc. I achieved all blue requirements, and some red, including adding audio tags, styling the page differently, and adding extra categories. If I had more time, I would've added a guess-counter and used my own images.
